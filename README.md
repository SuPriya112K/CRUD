# task1 for Team Nougat

A new Flutter project.

This project is a Flutter based application for Student Record Storage and Management using CRUD operations and Firestore Database and Firebase Authentication.

 It only has code for android app. macOS, linux, windows, etc folders are not present here because I did not choose those options when prompted. 

# Features -
1) User authentication and authorization using Firebase Authentication. - The files main.dart and login.dart contain the required code for user authentication and UI of the signup and login pages.
2) Efficient student record management using Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD) operations and Firestore Database.

# Technologies Used - 
1) Android Studio - IDE for app development.
2) Firebase -  for authentication and data management.
3) AI tools such as ChatGPT and Gemini for assistance.

# Challenges Faced - 
1) Integration and usage of Firebase services.
2) Creation of new profile from sign up page and verification in the login phase.
